# Graphite  

Graphite is a simple library to draw 2d graphics on your screen in Java.
It uses a JFrame (JPanel) and its graphics to draw shapes and texts to 
create simple graphics. <br>
(Inspired by the [__SuM__](https://www.mg-werl.de/sum/) library.)

## Usage
    - Create a Screen in your project with width, height and title
    - Create a Pen and link it to the screen
    - Use the functions of the pen to draw on the screen
    - Get keyboard and mouse input from the screen

## TODO
    - Better write function
    - More fonts
    - A way to edit font & font styles
    - Image loader
